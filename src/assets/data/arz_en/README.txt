Summary
===========================================================================================================

ArzEn-ST translation corpus contains the translations of the ArzEn speech corpus transcriptions into monolingual Egyptian Arabic and monolingual English. ArzEn speech corpus is a 12-hours spontaneous conversational speech corpus, obtained through informal interviews held at the German University in Cairo. The participants discussed broad topics, including education, hobbies, work, and life experiences. The corpus contains significant amounts of code-switching, covering the four main types of code-switching: inter-sentential, intra-sentential, extra-sentential, and intra-word code-switching. The recordings were transcribed and translated into monolingual Egyptian Arabic and monolingual English. This corpus contains the transcriptions and translations.

data :	Contains the transcriptions and translations files. The data can be found in the three folders:
    transcriptions:	 		the original transcriptions obtained from the recordings.
    translations_EgyptianArabic: 	the translations of transcriptions into monolingual Egyptian Arabic.
    translations_English: 		the translations of transcriptions into monolingual English.
The corpus has predefined train, dev, and test splits, as outlined in Hamed et al. (2020). The corresponding train, dev, and test files are found in each of the three mentioned folders.

The data files contain one utterance per line. Each line has two columns (tab separated):
(1) First column: utterance ID, which consists of [speaker_ID]-[corpus_ID]-[Recording_ID]_[timestamp_start]-[timestamp_end]
(2) Second column: the original transcription utterance or its translation, depending on the file.
